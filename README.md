## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This is a data analysis of various theater kickstarter campaigns, specifically plays, and their success rate in relationn to the launch date and the goals set of each of the campaigns.  
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends 
Based on the data it may be useful for Louise to begin her kickstarter campaign early in the year rather than late in the year, because the analysis shows that the most successful campaigns began in March and steadily inclined through May. It then saw a decline in success over the later months, specifically December. 
In addition, it appears that theater was one of the more favorable parent categories to have success compared to others which is a good sign for Louise. Futhermore, when the categories are broken down into subcategories 'plays' stand out the most. They are the most common campaigns in the data and surely have the most successful attempts then any other category. 
Also, when looking at the descriptive statistics, failed kickstarter campaigns had a much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. However, suprisingly there is a rise in successful campagins beginning around $25,000 to $29,999 up until $40,000-$44,999. Then a sharp decline in success once campaign goals goes past $44,999. It appears that as campaign goals are increased from less than $1,000 up to $25,000 - $29,000 there is a steady decline in success from 80% successful down to 20%. Once again interestingly, there is found success with campaigns that have goals between $25,000 - $29,000 and $40,000 - $44,999. These goals go from 20% success up to almost 70% success. Anything above $44,999, however it was met with a sharp decline downn to 0% successful.
